to get started do this:

git clone git@github.com:appsquickly/XcodeEditor.git
git clone git@github.com:kritzikratzi/ofxcode.git

(the two projects should be in the same folder)

changes needed in xcode-editor.xcodeproj:

	XCProjectBuildConfig.h is not set to public.
	open the project in xcode, select the file, open the properties (cmd+alt+0),
	select "public" instead of "project" next to the target membership


    go to the xcode-editor.xcodeproj, select the framework-target,
    change mach-o type to static library. 
    also disable "instrument program flow" and "generate test coverage files"


-- random crap --
had to add -ObjC flag for static lib compilation.
otherwise objc categories won't get loaded.
